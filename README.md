# Pokedex App With React
Pokedex app that I created with React.

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Framer-Motion, React, Firebase and React-Router-Dom as programming languages and libraries within the project. Filter Pokemons by category or typing their name. After clicking on the detailss button, you can update or delete the selected Pok√©mon. Additionally, you can add your own customized Pokemon upon request.

The project is live and you can see see it by visiting https://pokedex-app-with-react.web.app/
